I have incoprated what we learned this week about React and used the same cookie clocker game I used from week 4 to style it the same and use similar logic. I have tried to use everything required from teh user story and strecth goals apart from calling the API to give addtional upgrades. I did not do this step because I did not have neough time as I had to re-watch a lot of the lectures I missed early in the week. To improve this assignments, I would incorprate the upgrades in the API and provide a picture for each to make it more visually appealing...etc.
